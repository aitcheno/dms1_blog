## Assignment Update/Progress 28/03: 
After being given lots of good feedback from my peers and tutor, I worked on improving my piece for the final cut

A suggestion was to include more about my aspirations and my creative presence so I added some footage of me playing guitar, editing audio, and a glance at an image of one of my heroes

It was clear to me that some thought the first half was meant to be serene. It does look that way, but I wanted to juxtapose the beauty with the sombre guitar. The soundtrack mustn't have been sad enough so I added some eerie industrial noise beneath the first half to give a more uncertain and uneasy feeling to that half. I tried out putting rain over the top but it just sounded like frying bacon since the context was all mismatched. Very interesting

I have completed my video piece and now I'm ready to submit.

Here's the description/attributions again just so it's in more than one place


This piece is a reflective self-portrait which explores my lack of trajectory last year at The University of Melbourne, compared to the now hopeful, positive feelings I have since starting the Digital Media course at RMIT
