Above is the output of my editing experiment.

I had planned to juxtapose the silence in Milo's video and the noise in my own video through the editing.
I wanted to make the difference more obvious by increasing the volume on my video after each cut to Milo's

I paced the video by having more time spent on each clip further in the video. in order for the audience to have the contrast further engrained

Overall, this use of pacing and juxtaposition could signify a dislike or invoke a conversation for or about noise pollution
