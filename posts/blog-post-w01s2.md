## My Editing Experiment

Above is my output for the editing experiment

I had planned to juxtapose the silence in Milo's video and the noise in my own video through the editing.
I wanted to make the difference more obvious by increasing the volume on my video after each cut to Milo's

I paced the video by having more time spent on each clip after every cut, in order for the audience to have the contrast in volume further engrained

Overall, this use of pacing and juxtaposition could signify a dislike or invoke a conversation for or about noise pollution

## Assignment Update/Progress 09/03
I have started conceptualising the output for the first assignment. I'm planning to go for a more abstract approach, and try not to be too literal about everything shown on screen. I think the more reflective approach will be what I go for. Mainly discussing my growth and feelings coming into the course, while also showing my personality and interests just through what is captured i.e. musical equipment
