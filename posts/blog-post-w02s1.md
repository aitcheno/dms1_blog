## Storyboard Practice
![My Dr Strangelove Storyboard](/w02s1/storyboard_strangelove.jpg)
Above is my storyboard for the ending of Dr. Strangelove drawn in class as an exercise. It gave me a quick and rough guide to storyboarding, capturing the most important movements and all of the cuts. Now can I work on my own storyboard...

## Assignment Update/Progress 15/03
I have shot some footage outside for my project, but I found I was shooting aimlessly. Without my concept being developed enough I was lost on what I was doing

Because of this, I decided to start a Google Keep note to brainstorm and be more specific with my ideas

I outlined my vague idea of splitting the two minutes roughly in half. The first half being about being lost and unsure, and the second about growth, hope and partnership. My personality and interests, I plan to be made obvious by what is shown on screen, but the emotion and themes will be more abstract. 

I'll try and make a clear divide between each half through the music, pacing and the signified.

For example, the first half of the music will be quite sombre and reflective, while the second half will be more energetic and may reflect the growth theme through dynamics or tempo.

My main focus now is to shoot shoot and shoot some more but this time guided through my planning

While my aimless filming seemed pointless, I was able to imagine how I could use some of my footage with my more specified theme and outline.



## Storyboard for Assignment

Above is my drafted storyboard for the final video. Half of it was completed March 14th and the other half March 23rd. I tried to convey that the pacing in the first half is slow, and in the second half it's faster with shorter shots

I plan to establish and maintain continuity in my piece by having an omniscient camera, especially in the first half. This means, not having my shadow in the frame to ruin the illusion. As it is a montage, for the main part of the piece, I don't want it to feel as though I am the one behind the camera, except for more personal point of view shots in the second half. Moreover, I want to keep a smooth flow in order to maintain continuity. The shots must be edited in a way to not be jarring otherwise the viewer will be pushed back out of the world I am presenting.

Additionally, I plan to approach the editing in a way that will benefit and solidify the themes, concept and emotions. For the emotions of happiness and triumph in the second half, the editing will be fast paced and form an arch before slowing down in the end, whereas in the more reflective first half, the shots will be longer and far less rapid. For the overarching theme of growth, the match cut of a flower blooming will be one of the most obvious ways to portray this theme through editing.


## Assignment Update/Progress 20/03: 
I found myself just noodling on the guitar and suddenly a song came to me. I fleshed it out a bit and decided I could use it for my assignment. It was quite sombre so I was working out ways to bring it into the more energetic feeling for the second half. It's currently a work in progress, but that is progress!

I'm planning to shoot at Melbourne Uni before next class as it was where I studied last year and is what I'm basing the first half of my video on
