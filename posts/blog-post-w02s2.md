## A Key Moment in Project
A key moment in my video will be the transition between the first melancholic half, to the second triumphant half. The bridge from emotion to emotion is through a shot of a building that is half in shadow and half in sun. The camera pans up the building to the lit half, but it is the soundtrack which will reinforce the change in tone.

I've written the music so that the final chord will lead directly into the opening chord of the second half, so that the change is not so jarring. Put simply, I want the first half to be reflective and pensive, and the second half to be triumphant and hopeful, as such I have written the music to indicate that change in tone. 

Just a quick analysis of the piece I've written:
The first half - melancholic
- Single instrument = lonely
- Ambiguous key at times and lack of steady pulse = uncertainty

The second half - triumphant, hopeful
- Major key = happy
- I used I II IV progression because to me it sounds very hopeful
- Steady pulse = certainty

I've deliberately made these choices in the soundtrack to further develop and strengthen the sense of those emotions within the overall piece.

### post an updated version of your storyboard that accounts for the sonic elements of your project.


## Assignment Update/Progress 23/03: 
ADD SCREENSHOTS
After shooting at Melbourne Uni, I was able to capture some ridiculously obvious symbols, like lotus flowers for my growth theme, young trees or cut trees for the first half's themes of unsureness. Overall, most of the shots captured will be to set a location. Now I can complete my storyboard with those shot ideas!

I spent some time recording the music for my piece just with acoustic guitar, bass and then drums and piano sounds on my computer. Quite happy with the result. There are two distinct halves with two different emotions. Success. Here is a screenshot of the completed project on Reaper - yes it looks like logic... it's not
