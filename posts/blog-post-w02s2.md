## A Key Moment in Project
A key moment in my video will be the transition between the first melancholic half, to the second triumphant half. The bridge from emotion to emotion is through a shot of a building that is half in shadow and half in sun. The camera pans up the building to the lit half, but it is the soundtrack which will reinforce the change in tone.

I've written the music so that the final chord will lead directly into the opening chord of the second half, so that the change is not so jarring. Put simply, I want the first half to be reflective and pensive, and the second half to be triumphant and hopeful, as such I have written the music to indicate that change in tone. 

Just a quick analysis of the piece I've written:
The first half (melancholic):
- Single instrument = lonely
- Ambiguous key at times and lack of steady pulse = uncertainty

The second half (triumphant, hopeful)
- Major key = happy
- I used I II IV progression because to me it sounds very hopeful to me
- Steady pulse = certainty

I've deliberately made this choices in the soundtrack to further develop and strengthen the sense of those emotions within the overall piece.
