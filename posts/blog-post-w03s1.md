1. Based on your storyboard, produce a draft of your video portrait for Assignment 1. It doesn't have to be the finished version, but it should be pretty close.

2. Upload this draft to your YouTube or Vimeo account, post it to your blog, and write a blog post that discusses your process in producing this draft.

3. Prepare a brief written introduction to your work. It should explain your general concept and intentions with the work in a clear, concise, and professional manner. 

4. Place this introduction into the description of your draft on YouTube or Vimeo. Double-check that the link is ready for sharing in class during the next session.




## Assignment Update/Progress 23/03: 
I've been slowly working towards a final draft for my video. I'm quite satisfied with how the first half has turned out, and have tried to focus on the cuts being seamless. What was jarring in cutting was either a huge change in colour, contrast, subject location or no clear audio bridge. Most of the cuts land on obvious beats in the music, such as snare hits to prevent this. I've also tried taking breaks from working on the video so by the time I come back, I have a fresh perspective and can more objectively decipher what doesn't flow.
