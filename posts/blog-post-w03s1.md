## Assignment Update/Progress 23/03: 
I've been slowly working towards a final draft for my video. I'm quite satisfied with how the first half has turned out, and have tried to focus on the cuts being seamless. What was jarring in cutting was either a huge change in colour, contrast, subject location or no clear audio bridge. Most of the cuts land on obvious beats in the music, such as snare hits to prevent this. I've also tried taking breaks from working on the video so by the time I come back, I have a fresh perspective and can more objectively decipher what doesn't flow

Here's what I have completed so far

## Assignment Update/Progress 25/03: 
Have now finished my draft. Took some serious time but I'm finally half happy with the result. Had to sub in some footage because I haven't shot the RMIT part due to illness. I'll make sure to go in, film what I need to and put it in. Added footage shot at home because I was quite short on footage for the second half. All done. Now I wait for feedback.

## The First Draft

Above is my first draft; a reflective self-portrait which explores my lack of trajectory last year, compared with the now hopeful, positive feelings I have since starting the Digital Media course.

## The Process Of Creating This Draft

I laid down the audio track first and then built the piece from there

I added all the footage I wanted for a particular section and tried to match it up with what I had planned for on the storyboard. Some things worked and some things didn't so it was just about adjusting, trailing and fixing over and over again. As I said before, I had to shoot a bit more footage than I had so I did so and cut it all together.

Overall, the thing I spent the most time on in completing the draft was getting the timing and pacing of the cuts just right in order to make the piece flow. I did so until I had a finished draft
