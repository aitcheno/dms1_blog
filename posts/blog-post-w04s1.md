## Black Squares Activity

Above is the outcome for the black squares activity in which we were tasked to create a simple design based on the prompted word by using and rearranging four black squares. A test of creativity and I find that creativity is a lot simpler when there are limitations.

The first prompts, order and increase, were relatively simple, but the more abstract words like tension and bold were difficult to create through such a simple design. Completing so many different designs in such a short amount of time really got the creative brain flowing, and I left perfection behind. In doing so, I created some designs I'm not so proud of, but some of the ones I made on a whim ended up being my favourites. 

The process reminded me of sonmething I read in Atomic Habits by James Clear about a professor who did an experiment with his students dividing them into two groups. The first a quality group who were meant to focus on taking the best photo possible, and the second a quantity group who were told to take as many pictures as you can.

<font size="-3"> "At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo." Source: https://jamesclear.com/repetitions </font>

In completing this activity, I identified the parameters, which was only using black squares, as well as making the design convey the particular word. In the ideate stage of the design process, I tried to think outside the box, and used negative space to create a B for the bold prompt. I was struggling to create designs for bold and tension so I turned to the oblique strategies app on my phone. It was not much help for me today.

## Assignment 2 Prompt Brainstorming
![Mind Map For Assignment 2](/w04s1/memory-mind-map.PNG)
Above is my mind map for the concept of memory. I tried to think of how we use memory and how technology can help extend our memory. In doing this activity, I was able to come up with a vague concept for the upcoming assignment, just through breaking down a particular theme. 

## Assignment 2 Idea
With the prompt I've chosen being memory, I want to create icons for an app that serves as life documentation. Just for some more flexibility, I'm imagining this app to be used in the future when there are chips conencted to our brain that can record our sensual information. 

The app will be able to capture pictures, videos, scents, and sound from your point of view which you can store within the app as a sort of memory database. 

Device - Smart Phone
Context - Navigational Icons in an App
Audience - Humans who want to document their lives and relive their memories at a level their normal brain cannot.

I'll outline my concept through some design thinking just to get my ideas flowing. 
Empathise with users - Humans have limited storage in their short term memory and the long term memory is hard to maintain, so an app which documents moments in their life could be appealing to those wanting to hold onto their memories with little effort. 

Define - The user would want and need to document their memories in all different forms, whether it be writing, video, audio or smell. They would want to relive their memories in the most realistic way. This is because human memory is flawed. Many memories become hazy or even untrue, so having a personal database of your life could be beneficial for reflection and your identity.
