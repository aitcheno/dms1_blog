## Black Squares Activity

Above is the outcome for the black squares activity in which we were tasked to create a simple design based on the prompted word by using and rearranging four black squares. A test of creativity and I find that creativity is a lot simpler when there are limitations.

The first prompts, order and increase, were relatively simple, but the more abstract words like tension and bold were difficult to create through such a simple design. Completing so many different designs in such a short amount of time really got the creative brain flowing, and I left perfection behind. In doing so, I created some designs I'm not so proud of, but some of the ones I made on a whim ended up being my favourites. 

The process reminded me of sonmething I read in Atomic Habits by James Clear about photographers.
"On the first day of class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida, divided his film photography students into two groups.

<font size="-3">Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.

Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.

At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo." Source: https://jamesclear.com/repetitions </font>
