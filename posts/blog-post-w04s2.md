## Thumbnail Sketching Activity
![Fishing Icons](/w04s2/fishing.jpg)
Above is my outcome for the thumbnail sketching activity. I chose fishing as my verb to represent through an icon design.
It was difficult to keep coming up with ideas for variation within the time frame but I managed to complete 16 semi-unique icons. I added the last 4 out of the time window.
To my eyes, the most effective icon is the one fourth along in the first row. I think it manages to communicate the idea of fishing in a simple way. It has all the necessary items, a boat, water, a person, a fishing rod, and a fish. Just through some simple lines, an image is formed and communicated. To me, that's what a good icon does; it communicates an idea and its meaning is instinctive.

## My Own Thumbnail Sketches
Below are the sketches for my own icons. They are each for a different function, and I tried to convey that function through either existing and well known icons or unique creations of my own.
### Record Live Audio
![Record Audio Icon Sketches](/w04s2/audio.jpg)
This tool is used to turn what you hear into digital sound that will be stored in your devices memory. I thought up existing icons like the old simplistic microphone, as well as the example of an ear to represent sound. 

i feel as though the best design here is the bottom right. While I like the ears, it is difficult to simplify an ear. I think I'll go for the currently all too trendy minimalist design.
![Download Thoughts Icon Sketches](/w04s2/download.jpg)
This tool is used to download your current thoughts. I wanted to use the representation of lightbulbs for thoughts, so I combined that with some way to denote downloading.

The strongest design is probably the one in the centre, and those two to the left of it. Pretty straight forward and nicely combines the two icons together.
![Favourite Memory Icon Sketches](/w04s2/favourite.jpg)
I'm still quite unsure of what to do with this one. It is the icon for your favourite memories. 

I like the combination of the memory card and heart the most maybe. There are many different ways to convey favourite so this is still a work in progress.
![Memory Gallery Icon Sketches](/w04s2/gallery.jpg)
These icons represent the gallery where all the memories are stored, like a normal camera gallery.

I really like all the designs here. The brain might have to go, as it probably won't work as a family towards the end. I might say that the strongest design just based on what I like so far is the icon on the top right. It combines a well known icon with something extra which is the RAM-like pins.
![Random Memory Icon Sketches](/w04s2/random.jpg)
This icon is for a randomiser which would play a random memory.

I think the strongest design is the question mark with the cloud, but overall I think this design needs some refining. I'm unsure if I will include this randomiser idea.
![Screenshot Vision Icon Sketches](/w04s2/screenshot.jpg)
This icon is for capturing what is seen through your eyes: similar to a screenshot

I like the simplicity of the camera icon. I tried to simplify it to its main components. Either of the top two design here I think are strong. Conveying the capturing part and using a known icon for screenshotting.
![Search Memory Icon Sketches](/w04s2/search.jpg)
This icon is for searching your memories

I think I took too little time sketching these out, so they are a bit uninspired. Perhaps the one with the cloud is most strong and I can refine it. I want to make sure that this icon fits into the family.
![Settings Icon Sketches](/w04s2/settings.jpg)
This icon is for the settings within the application.

To be frank, I'm quite unimpressed with my laziness in not only choosing this icon, but also the sketches I completed. I clearly struggled with getting the symmetry right. I think this idea might be scrapped altogether.
![Record Previous Vision](/w04s2/vision.jpg)
This icon is for recording the previous 30 seconds of your vision, much like a Nintendo Switch, dashcam records after the fact

I really like the idea of using eyes here. The bottom two might be the strongest. Lots of combining here.
