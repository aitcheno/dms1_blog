## Thumbnail Sketching Activity
![Fishing Icons](/w04s2/fishing.jpg)
Above is my outcome for the thumbnail sketching activity. I chose fishing as my verb to represent through an icon design.
It was difficult to keep coming up with ideas for variation within the time frame but I managed to complete 16 semi-unique icons. I added the last 4 out of the time window.
To my eyes, the most effective icon is the one fourth along in the first row. I think it manages to communicate the idea of fishing in a simple way. It has all the necessary items, a boat, water, a person, a fishing rod, and a fish. Just through some simple lines, an image is formed and communicated. To me, that's what a good icon does; it communicates an idea and its meaning is instinctive.

## My Own Thumbnail Sketches
Below are the sketches for my own icons. They are each for a different function, and I tried to convey that function through either existing and well known icons or unique creations of my own.
### Record Live Audio

This tool is used to turn what you hear into digital sound that will be stored in your devices memory. I thought up existing icons like the old simplistic microphone, as well as the example of an ear to represent sound.
