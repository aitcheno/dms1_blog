## Pen Tool Exercises
It took me many many many moons to refine and finally understand how the pen tool works. It's not the most intuitive tool in the world but the more I practiced the more it made sense. 
Here are the results of the tracing exercise with the pen tool.

Excuse my circles. I didn't want to cheat by using the shapes tool. Perfecting the curves is something I still need to work on.

## Painting Tracing

Above is my output for the more natural tracing of an Edward Hopper painting. As great as he is, I wouldn't want to live in some of his paintings. 

As you can tell, I struggled to make the landscape look like a landscape without colour. There is little depth. The house and lighthouse came out alright thought.
I tried my best to just aim to trace the most important and noticeable lines. I was thinking about line and form a lot here.

In other words, I was trying to do as little as possible with a viewer still being able to tell what the picture is with some detail.

This is the output for the EXTREMELY geometric Hopper tracing. 
At first glance, it lacks depth. I mainly stuck to the squares, and I started to use the pathfinder tool to combine some shapes. 

While I attempted to make it very simple, I found myself adding more and more squares. New details kept presenting themselves. This is the problem of art. When do you stop? When is a piece finished?

Overall, this was a good exercise in using Illustrator as well as refining things to their most simple form.

## Progress
![Icon Drafts](/w05s1/icon-draft.png)
Here is the current iteration of my icons. As you can tell I have scrapped the settings icon and replaced it with a bin, decided on designs, as well as come up with dice for the randomiser. Happy with the progress so far. 

HOWEVER, I am unhappy with how they look as a family
I want to:

    - Make all the curvature similar
    - Remove those angular shapes in the first icons
    - Work on the sizing of the icons, and the shapes within the icons.

![Colour Exercise](/w05s1/colours.png)
Here is the result of me messing around with colours.
I learned how to create a palette using the blend tool. This was completely experimental and useful to me. It really showed me what not to do, which is always a great thing.

It's clear that my shapes were not formed correctly. The pen tool making paths makes it difficult so I'm going to have to use shapes a lot more or find a workaround.

To me, all the monochromatic designs look the best. They are very soothing which is something I want from my designs. As they are for a somewhat reflective app, a soothing colour scheme would be more than ideal.
