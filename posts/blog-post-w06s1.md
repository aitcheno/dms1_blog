## Sound!
Now that my designs are nearing their completion, I created my sounds for each icon. 

I wanted to create the sounds myself to give myself a comfortable amount of freedom. I used REAPER to create the sounds using MIDI instruments. 
My goal was to make the sounds have similar elements so they were all cohesive. 
I used a piano sound for the gallery and search function. Both have a bright and kind of questioning chord playing. 

For the gallery icon, I wanted to show the combination of natural and synthetic, like its design with the landscape that looks like a computer chip. For this, I used the piano but then brought in some sine waves underneath.

For the video and sound recorder, I used a nice slightly tremoloed sound. I created it for the sound recorder then sampled it for the video. With the video sound though, I made it pitch down and then make a similar bouncing note sound like the lightbulb. 

Overall, I thought of existing sounds for each respective icon and tried to make them unique to this suite, yet also cohesive.

Here is the project for the completed sounds. I bounced out each sound just using the time selection tool.

## Progress 
I have been hard at work tweaking my designs. I have now remade every one of my icons. This way I could tweak what I disliked and what didn't suit. Additionally, I made sure all the shapes worked well together, there was consistent roundness on the corners, and that each section could be painted.

Once I had my head around what the finished icons were going to look like, I thought about their animation. I knew I wanted small movements; nothing too jarring. 

From here, I worked one by one on the changed design. I did really simple edits like changing the colour of one object and moving it slightly. I did what I thought was appropriate for each icon. 

I wanted to test these sooner rather than later, so I imported them into my website !

I used the code Thomas had set up. I first renamed all the audio and imported that. It worked!
It was then easy to export, rename and import the icons. 

I chose a nice like pink after many tests as I felt it worked well with the blue and was very light and soothing like how I wanted the icons to be.

Here was the result, but I soon faced a challenge...

## Alignment
The biggest problem I had was aligning the changed and unchanged icons. Getting them to not move over by a couple pixels was a pain.

It took me a little bit but I figured I could add a nice invisible box that would equal in size for both the changed and unchanged. So when I selected the elements I wanted to export, it worked as a frame for the icons.

This was really useful in keeping each icon the same height and helped with the cohesion of the suite.

## The Shading
I forgot to mention, so far, the shading I have been adding on the icons. After researching similar flat design icons, I knew I wanted to implement this.

I saw in a tutorial someone adding this really neat trick. You put a black box on half of your icon, cut it out with the shape edit tool, and then lower the opacity on it.

It makes so much sense to do, and I'm sure you can do the same with white or whatever tint you wanted. 

So, for every icon I have been adding this black box with an opacity of 10%
