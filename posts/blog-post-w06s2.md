## Finalisation
After some hard work, I have finally finished my icons, their sounds and animation. I am quite happy with the result and it's great to see them altogether living happily online.

I pretty much just continued the process I had been working on. Remaking the icons, then colouring, and then creating the changed design

I made sure to focus on how the colours were going to match up and be similar in each design. For most of my designs, the centre is the focus so I ensured that the colour would pop out.

I uploaded them all into the website code and then set up the GitHub website.

I noticed the alignments weren't quite right for some icons, and I messed up the colours and animation movement for some. It was easy to go back into my project and tweak what I had.

Speaking of my project. This is the final state in Illustrator

Very messy. I was unsure of how I should use the space and workflow. Being vectors I could have worked in a smaller area but I feel a bit more creative with the mess. Something to work on for sure.

Here is a screenshot of my final uploaded designs in the preview.

Now to begin working on this memory bank enhancer.
