## Introduction To Unity
Here is the solar system I created in class in unity. It helped me get my head around moving objects and adjusting their scale.

The planets are accurate in their relative size, but the distances are clearly inaccurate.

## Assignment Brainstorming
Below is my written out brainstorm for my creative concept. I first thought of some significant changes in my life and then decided on something quite cute: Becoming the owner of a cat.

I thought about each section of the space and what would change as the environment progresses.

### Concept Statement
The overarching meaningful change I will present in my environment is becoming the owner of a cat. The environment will slowly change from a quite sombre and dissonant location, to one of peace, tranquility and freedom. This coincides with how owning a cat changed my usual mental state, and the peace my cat brought me. Through the visual aesthetic and audio, I intend to present this new experience.

### Visual Breakdown of Environment
Below is a bird's eye view of my map I have laid out
![Map](/w07s1/map.jpg)
For the open space, I'm thinking of a zen garden inspired environment, especially since I plan to include a temple with the cat shrine. 
For the room that leads into said space, I want it to be cosy and plan to base the room off of library-type rooms I have saved on Pinterest

## Side Note
I'm not sure if I'm being too ambitious but I would really love it if the environment could start with low poly N64 style models and textures, and then slowly become more detailed as the player explores the environment. Whether I can create these low poly models or source them I'm unsure yet, but I think it would reinforce the progression of the change. For owning a cat gave me peace and clarity.

As you can see, the textures are especially compressed and grimy. I really like this effect and I'm surprised it hasn't become a trend in indie games like pixelated styles have.
