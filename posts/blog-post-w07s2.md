## Greybox Prototype
After getting versed in the terrain tool in class, as well as adding the player, I started working on my greybox prototype. The map I created made this pretty straight forward.

A quick note on the player controller, I reduced the speed and sensitivity by more the half. The player was simply too fast to absorb anything in the environment!

What was most time consuming was creating the rooms. I figured it would be best to roughly create the space, instead of using a box to represent the area. Getting the scale of the rooms finished now will save me some time.

I used the terrain tool just to create some building type shapes to represent the asset that will go there. 

Making sure there were no gaps in the walls and that were all aligned right took some effort, but I finally finished the rough structure of the building part of the environment.

I lastly layed a terrain down and used the texture given in class. Put in a cube to represent the temple that will go there, and a block to represent the bridge.

I think I'm quite happy with the scale, and the environment definitely opens up and slowly presents a sense of freedom. 

I want to naturally limit the player's freedom in the open space, so I'm thinking of doing this through mountains, trees, rocks or maybe water obstacles.
