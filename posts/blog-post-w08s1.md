## Perspective Activity
I chose Christ The Redeemer as the landmark to recreate. I did so with very simple shaped planes.

Here is Jesus as a whole

And here He is from another perspective.

Already when working in Unity, I'm finding I place an object and looks to be the perfect size, only to realise that it is 100 units away and very large. 


## Spatial Composition
Without knowing it, I have already been thinking about the composition of my space but I will break it down with the elements learnt in class.

Depth: The hallway I have created gives a clear sense of depth with a vanishing point.
I also am planning to create depth from the view of the windows. Each will show the cityscape next to the building and give a false sense of the buildings height.

Distance: I plan to create distance in the hallway by repeating doors on either side of the walls. 
Similarly in the open space, I plan to use similar sized trees to create a sense of distance, as those further away will appear smaller.

Movement: I'm looking to entice movement through the clear path for the player. Whether through the hallway or through a path in the open spaced section.

## Progress
I have started adding textures and some assets into my space. I'm starting with the first room where the player spawns.

So far, I think I've successfully made the space feel grim and dull. Furthermore, its quite overwhelming small and confined, creating even more of a sense of unease. They'll be a world outside that the player won't be able to reach. Once the lighting is how I want it, and the cityscape is in the background, this part of the environment should come together nicely

I added in the lights as you can see and placed a point light where each fixture is. I worked out how to add the emission texture for the asset making it look illuminated.

Here's the structure from the outside so far.

On longer 3D Objects, the textures look really stretched (as you can see on the left) so I'm going to have to find a workaround for that.

So far, I can tell it will be a time consuming project, as the hours I've spent VS my progress isn't as aligned as I'd like it to be. It's obvious I've thrown away the idea of making my own low poly assets already! Hopefully I will get better at using Unity and the overall process will become faster.
