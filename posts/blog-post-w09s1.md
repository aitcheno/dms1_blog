## The Rebooting
Just through opening up task manager I found that the amount of power Unity was using was going through the roof, so when it comes to playtesting, it uses so much power my computer can't handle it and reboots. 

I've found if I go slowly through the environment; the computer is happy. If I go too fast it just gives up.

It has rebooted too many times to count so far, so it's been quite a struggle when I want to see how something looks from the player's perspective. Just an obstacle I have to work with I'm afraid

## Stair Trouble
Another failed plan unfortunately. I originally wanted the stairs to either appear or move down from the sky, as if it presented a new path for the player after they hit a hidden trigger. 

After many hours just trying to animate the stairs, through Youtube tutorials, I did not succeed. I followed about 3 different tutorial, and some way or another they would not work!

It seems the due date is nigh and I must keep working, so I might have to scratch this idea unfortunately. Hopefully the change in environment and its mood will be clear without the appearing stairs

## Progress
After the stair debacle I created the outdoor terrain!

I'm not sure if my process of creating the environment section by section has been most efficient. In future for this kind of project I think it would be best if I had added all the textures then all the assets, all the sounds etc. property by property. 

That's a note for the future but here's what I've accomplished:

Trees! They look great. Sculptured the terrain and painted trees on. Did so with an extension for the terrain too thanks to this tutorial:

Really happy with the result. You can see the final cat statue and the path I've painted on.

Here's another update with more texture painted on the terrain because it was looking a little too green with the hills.

Looking promising. Many setbacks, many times progress has not been saved but I must keep keeping on.

I need to enclose this space somehow. Whether it's through mountains in the background or a backdrop. If the player turns around, they'll see the city buildings in the background, so I'll need to come up with a way to block that out.
