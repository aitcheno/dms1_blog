## Progress
I've spent a lot of time doing minor tweaks to my environment. Added a lot of sound in the outdoor environment which I've decided to discuss in the Space and Sound blog.

The main thing I have added is a backdrop enclosing the outdoor environment. I did this so the player could not see the buildings in the background, and a lighting issue that I will talk about in a minute. 

I'm quite happy with the artificial effect of it. It feels like the environment is very controlled. As if the experience of owning a cat came from a higher power.

## Lighting Issues
My original plan was to have a trigger change the skybox and therefore the light within the game. That's why the original map plan was shaped so you couldn't see that change.

I struggled to find a good video demonstrating how to change the skybox in this context, so I scratched that idea along with the moving stairs. 

What I was left with was the skybox being dark at the dark for the nighttime cityscape, and this darkness continuing into the outdoor space WHICH I DID NOT WANT. 

The darkness was great for the bleak starting section, with the lights really working well. I added warm lit chandeliers into the more comforting area floorboarded area to light that area up. 

With the outdoor area, I needed to light without it seeping into the buildings. 

With limited time, I decided to create the very simple and solid backdrop, and use very very bright point lights to emulate the Sun.

In Unity, if you don't want the light to magically move through solid objects, you have to add shadows, so that's what I did, making the game run quite badly.

Here is the final zoomout, without the used skybox, just so you can see everything

## Concept Reflection
The meaningful change I have chosen to focus my environment on is becoming a cat owner.

Almost all of my life, I hadn't really been exposed to cats. All my friends and family had dogs, so cats, as a pet, were very foreign to me.

For my 18th birthday my Mum gifted me a kitten. I was flawed by how small he was. I named him Hugo

The amount of comfort and happiness he brings to everyday life is immeasurable and I wanted to capture that in this environment.

The environment begins very sterile, cramped and dissonant, before leading into a more comforting, spacious and warm lit environment. The player is encouraged to explore, much like a cat would, and this leads them into an outdoor environment.

They follow the path, with tranquil ambient sounds, until they are greeted with a kind of cat shrine where tones ring out forever in an environmental bliss.

The environment feels very controlled, with walls always closing the player in. This was to capture how I had no control in receiving a cat. It was a gift, that means a whole lot more than any material object.

Overall, I have tried to capture the sudden tranquility I felt when I became the owner of my cat.

Here he is supervising my work.

## Mac Build
I quickly changed the settings so I could create a Mac Build. Did so, and uploaded it to Google Drive. Hopefully it's playable. I was quite unsure which files to add

All submitted. While I would love to keep tweaking, making the environment more detailed and fixing the issues, I'm glad there's a deadline.
