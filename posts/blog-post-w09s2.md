## Progress
I've spent a lot of time doing minor tweaks to my environment. Added a lot of sound in the outdoor environment which I've decided to discuss in the Space and Sound blog.

The main thing I have added is a backdrop enclosing the outdoor environment. I did this so the player could not see the buildings in the background, and a lighting issue that I will talk about in a minute. 

I'm quite happy with the artificial effect of it. It feels like the environment is very controlled. As if the experience of owning a cat came from a higher power.

## Lighting Issues
My original plan was to have a trigger change the skybox and therefore the light within the game. That's why the original map plan was shaped so you couldn't see that change.

I struggled to find a good video demonstrating how to change the skybox in this context, so I scratched that idea along with the moving stairs. 

What I was left with was the skybox being dark at the dark for the nighttime cityscape, and this darkness continuing into the outdoor space WHICH I DID NOT WANT. 

The darkness was great for the bleak starting section, with the lights really working well. I added warm lit chandeliers into the more comforting area floorboarded area to light that area up. 

With the outdoor area, I needed to light without it seeping into the buildings. 

With limited time, I decided to create the very simple and solid backdrop, and use very very bright point lights to emulate the Sun.

In Unity, if you don't want the light to magically move through solid objects, you have to add shadows, so that's what I did, making the game run quite badly.

Here is the final zoomout, without the used skybox, just so you can see everything

## Mac Build
I quickly changed the settings so I could create a Mac Build. Did so, and uploaded it to Google Drive. Hopefully it's playable. I was quite unsure which files to add

All submitted. While I would love to keep tweaking, making the environment more detailed and fixing the issues, I'm glad there's a deadline.
