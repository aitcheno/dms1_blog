## Reflecting
### Assignment 1 - Video Edit
How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?
    The sonic elements seemed to be the backbone of the edit. I based the timing of the cuts and all the visual aspects based on the soundtrack I had created. 
How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?
    Footage came partly from me just getting out there and filming what I thought would be useful, and fit a general theme, but once I had more of a plan, I was able to search and shoot specific things. From that, I structured the piece accordingly. So really, it was the footage that shaped the piece, and I hand picked what would fill in the gaps to enhance the key pieces of footage.
What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?
    For me, the main sound I used was the score. This have been the downfall of the piece. With such a prominent score, and not much action in the footage, diagetic sound didn't quite fit. 
    Emotional experience was created, however, through that soundscore, and I used my knowledge of music analysis to shape the emotions within the piece. It was the visual aspects that enhanced the score, due to the structure of my process. If I had the piece laid out without sound, then I feel I would have learned more about the power of sound through potential experimenting.
How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?
    Editing cuts completely changes the pace and rhythm of a piece. In my piece, I tried to nail the pacing, and as such, time was conveyed. The first half was slow rhythmically; the pace was slow. This then ramped up along with the soundscore and had a pretty consistent rhythm with the cuts. Through this pacing, I tried to convey opposing moods as well as time through the tone changes. 
Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?
    I chose the reflective route for the self portrait. I depicted my past through studying at Melbourne University, then my interests through what I was doing and showcasing, as well as my potential future figuratively. I used a lot of symbols that represented new beginnings and rebirth, because that is what I was feeling after changes universities, and paths.
What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?
    I wanted to frame things nicely, especially for the first half. I wanted the beautiful campus surroundings at Melbourne to feel lonely, empty and maybe lifeless. Whereas, for the second half, I wanted the piece to feel lively and full of hope. So I drew on nature to express my ideas for the piece.

### Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons
How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?
    The idea was for an enhancement to a human's memory. The app would record your senses and store them to a capacity and accuracy impossible for the human brain. I chose memory as the theme, because it was simply one that gave me the most ideas for icons.
Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?
    I iterated quite a bit, designs got thrown away, tweaked and evaluated constantly, so by the time I was actually creating the designs in Illustrator, they were mostly realised. What changed across the iterations was the accessibility, and intuitiveness in designs. I ultimately chose from drafts and tweaked so that someone who had no idea what the icon did could take a really good guess.
How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?
    With a lot of tweaking I came to my final designs. The designs translated quite well, because I wasn't focusing on colour yet. So shapes and ideas could be made in Illustrator quite easily having straight lines and being scaled appropriately. What was gained was the professional look of the designs, as well as cohesion especially through colour. Some designs did get lost along the way because I either thought they were lazy or uninspiring. 
How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?
    I chose a monochromatic colour palette in order to make the designs soothing. This is because I wanted the app to be reflective. I made the icons cohesive not only by the unity of colour, but also by the placement of value. Each icon had a shadow halfway across, but also I made sure the focal point of each icon was the same colour across the designs and that the value of the less prominent parts were all equal. This just helped create cohesion through the users attention and the overall weight of each icon.
How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?
    Sound I find to be a lot more abstract, so I tried to make the sounds for each icon fitting. While I tried to make the sound quite soothing, like the visual design, I feel as though I was more focused on the use case for each icon.
How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?
    Planning, planning and more planning. I made sure I had a strong idea, as well as the key icons I wanted. From there I thought about how I translate that, while also thinking about the elements of design. So the abstract noun became more structured and I was able to have a clear goal and vision.

### Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment
How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?
    It was useful in planning out space. I was able to think about the scale of the environment and how it would flow. Overall, it offered me a clear way to work through the project, and build from the prototype.
How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?
    It was so very different. I have never worked in a digital program that uses a third dimension, so it was fun, difficult but still rewarding. The main difference was the third dimension being there. It changed all of my ideas and scale and placement, and there was a lot more to think about, other than colour and 2D arrangment. 
What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?
    The virtual camera in this project was a lot more like a point of view, whereas for Assignment 1 it was more of a window into a world. The camera for my assignment 1 project didn't really move within shots, so I feel as though the editing was more important than the camera, whereas for Assignment 3, the camera was what I focused on. It was the camera's perspective and the emotional the user would feel through vision that was most important.
How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?
    3D sound was all too much fun. I could really create space and convey ideas through the sound. It was like creating a virtual sound experience. I used the volume due to distance to overlap harmonies and this was far more experimental than what I created for Assignments 1 and 2. Sound in those assignments was straightforward and was used for a clear effect. With assignment three, I focused more on experimenting and overlapping to create a mood.
How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?
    Again with this project, this all unfolded through planning, planning and more planning. I unified the environment with a theme by somewhat breadcrumbing the player. There was a clear path and a clear change in the mood of the environments, through sound, texture and colour. The theme evolved over the development mainly through how I was going to slowly showcase the changing of the environment. I wanted changes to be slow rather than sudden, in showing the tranquility I felt after owning a cat.
What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?
    The sound, mood and scale of the piece. I was able to see how sound was working within the environment, what mood the environment gave off, and how effective it was. Mainly though, I could work on the scale of each of the areas and how that made the player feel. 

## Ideas For My Website
For my web design, I'm thinking of reflecting on my work across the semester and then discussing where that leads me. I'm really unsure on the aesthetic I want to go for and I think I need to narrow down an image for myself in order to create an aesthetic
    - What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
        Simple, cohesive, and well organised.
     - Who is the target audience?
        Someone unfamiliar with me
     - What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?
        Links to work, animations within the webpage.
