## Figma!
Here's a screenshot of me testing out Figma for the first time

My first thoughts are that it reminds me very much of the Google apps. I'm quite well versed in those, so I'm hoping it will be intuitive to me. I've also noticed so far that the shortcuts are the same as Adobe commands, so what I learned in Illustrator can easily be transferred to here. Overall, Figma seems like a straightforward app.

I'm also trying to be forward thinking, so I've been searching up how to create some animations within the app. This doesn't seem too complicated, so I should be able to experiment.

I've slowly been writing and editing the written elements of the webpage in a Google Doc. I've tried to reflect mainly on learning and how my practice has evolved over the semester. Still a work in progress. Hopefully, once I start designing, my thoughts will come together.
