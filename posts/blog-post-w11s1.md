## Wireframing a Website From Memory
I decided to make the wireframe for Instagram mobile within Figma. 
Here is my attempt next to the actual Instagram homepage

I was very close but added too many circles at the top, and forgot the heart icon at the top.
So here is the result after tweaking that

## Wireframes for My Webpage
I don't know what it is but I feel some kind of creative block at the moment. I usually love designing things along these lines but nothing really great is coming to me. Through my research and experimenting, I'm seeing the limitations of Figma. The number one thing is the lack of sound! I'm quite uninspired but here are my ideas for my webpage structure:

I decided to go with the third wireframe I came up with. The others have just too many boxes, which is a tad boring, so hopefully the third one with the wavy timeline will be a bit more interesting. Again, the inspiration is not coming to me. I've been over the examples my classmates have uploaded but none I feel I can create in Figma. Sound would be great but even my attempts of adding youtube videos within prototypes has failed!

Another note: I opted for drafting on paper just because the process would be faster. I could get ideas flowing quickly.

## Building In Figma
From the wireframe I created, I started working on the design, but first I started with the colour scheme I wanted to use.
Green is my favourite colour so I figured I might as well use it in a webpage about myself and my practice so I decided on a analogous green palette.

With that I created the top of the page with a banner which I think sums up myself and my practice quite accurately. It has my cat, clear audio related equipment and software. It has a nice and personal energy to it.

The design may be a bit simple which I'm not a hundred percent happy with, but I'd love to make my name interactive. I'll most likely end up adjusting it all.
