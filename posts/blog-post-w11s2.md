## Adding More To The Website
I've been hard at work finishing off the written and adding more sections to the webpage.
The first thing I did was add the wavy timeline. Here is the result of that:

I did so by using the pen tool and adding shapes. I'm trying to be diligent with my components, so that animating and creating the mobile version should be quite easy. The timline I combined into a component. The workflow is quite easy so far.

## Decorating and Writing
As seen in my wireframe. I want images to go outside of the textboxes, so I thought it would be playful to get some of my icons and my design process just as decorations, rather than focusing on one part of a large process.
Here is the result of me adding my icons into the webpage

It adds a nice playful element and I've tried to position them so that the balance is right.

I continued this for each Assignment and just filled in where the text would go with some lorem ipsum I created myself. High level stuff

Looking okay so far. A bit unimpressed by the solid background, I think I can try something a bit more sleak and less outdated. Still lots to add and then animate to make it all come together.
