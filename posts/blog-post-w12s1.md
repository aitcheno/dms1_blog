## Progress
I've added in all the text and added some final reflection points about my trajectory with this course. It got a little more philosophical than I intended but I think that is characteristic of me, so it's staying.

## Animating
Here are some progress photos of me animating the webpage.

The process involved turning the section into a component, duplicating the component so you could create separate states, and then choosing the order the states and how they would function.

Take me back to powerpoint animations please!
I feel like Figma have made it so you can do more complex animations but simple ones are just too difficult with this method. 

This crappy part of the workflow led to me crushing my dreams of what to include in the website. I really wanted more playful and fun animations, like all the pictures to dance around into their spot, or mouse interactions with everything. It was obvious this wouldn't be feasible with such limited time left to submit this assignment, as well as all the other assignments I have to submit.

Really a shame. So very simply, the animations I've created are just fade ins when the mouse enters the area.

I'm thoroughly disappointed with the amount I'm able to do. I've still got the mobile version to complete. Time is of the essence, and I must be smart with the time I've got.
