## Mobile Version
It took some serious work, and I regret not using that block formatting, but I was able to transfer my webpage into a fitting format for phone. A few things needed repositioning, and the wavy timeline couldn't be done too effectively without changing the scale a stupid amount. 

I tried to transfer the animated components over, but seriously no luck. I couldn't chang the elements properly. It was a mess. Really unfortunate. So what I've created with my lack of time left is just a web page with little interactive elements.

## Reflection
If I'm honest with myself, I'm quite disappointed with the outcome of this website. For some reason, time and inspiration really escaped me. Better to submit something I'm not happy with than nothing at all though, so it is what it is.

Looking forward to a bit of a break.

## Larger Reflection
I've really enjoyed my semester so far. Especially in this studio class. Fast paced and I've learned so much through learning that is half guided by the class and half by myself. Really great to be able to create things I never would have otherwise.

A thank you to you Thomas, if you're reading this. You've made class very engaging and have always added your opinions and expertise to the class resources which is great. I also like that when we ask questions which have subjective answers, you guide us to find the answer ourselves. Such a great introduction to this course, with such a great tutor, so thank you :)
